The School Managment Portal
The School Management Portal is a school enrollment and performance management system built with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. It allows administrators to manage student, teacher, class, grade, and attendance records through a user-friendly interface. The application provides role-based access (admin), real-time data tracking, and easy report generation (exportable to Microsoft Excel and Word).

Key Features:
1. User authentication and authorization: Administrators can create, update, and delete user accounts, assign roles, and grant permissions.
2. Student management: Add, update, delete, and search for students, including their personal information, academic records, and attendance data.
3. Teacher management: Add, update, delete, and search for teachers, including their personal information and class assignments.
4. Class management: Create, update, delete, and search for classes, including their name, grade, and teacher.
5. Grade management: Assign grades to students, update grades, and search for specific grades and students.
6. Attendance management: Track attendance for students, update attendance records, and generate attendance reports.
7. Role-based access: Administrators have access to all features while other users only have limited access to specific sections.
8. Real-time data tracking: Data updates are reflected immediately in the user interface, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.
9. Easy report generation: Exportable reports (Microsoft Excel and Word) are generated for administrators, allowing them to analyze and share data with stakeholders.
10. Customizable dashboards: Administrators can create customizable dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and track progress over time. (note: This feature is yet to be implemented.)
